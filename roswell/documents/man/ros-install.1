When the \f[C]impl\f[] or \f[C]system\f[] matches to one of the
supported implementations, it fetches, downloads and installs it to one
of the internal directory managed by roswell (~/.roswell, or
\f[C]ROSWELL_INSTALL_DIR\f[]).
In order to use the installed implementation, you have to run
\f[I]ros\-use(1)\f[].
.PP
For example, the following command downloads the latest sbcl binary from
sbcl.org.
Note that this may be different from the default binary installed by
roswell, called \f[C]sbcl\-bin\f[].
\f[C]sbcl\-bin\f[] is a stable and well\-tested version of the sbcl
binary which is supposed to be a little older than the latest sbcl.

When invoked without a name, it prints the list of installable

After compiling and loading the system, it funcalls
\f[C]ros:*build\-hook*\f[] special variable with no argument, if some
function is set during the compilation/load.
.PP
When the system comes with a \f[B]roswell script\f[] created by
\f[I]ros\-init\f[](1) in the subdirectory \f[C]roswell\f[], they are
installed into \f[B]ROSWELL_INSTALL_DIR/bin\f[].
Setting the path to this directory makes those scripts available from
the shell command line.
